# ACSproject1
# Goal of the Project: 
This project's goal is to explore the American Community Survey (ACS) dataset. The USA Census Bureau publishes this dataset every year. The ACS data comprises a multitude of demographic, economic, personal, and household data relating to individuals. To learn more about this data set visit "https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs". 

This project has been a part of my Microeconometrics course.  Dr. Timothy Harris created this problem set to help the class learn STATA. However, I will use his problem set and solve it in R in this project. 

I will do the following- 

1. Create a histogram of Salary income past 12 months for Civilian Employed, at work
2. Create a table that reports the median, mean of "Wages or salary income past 12 months" for different categories
3. Create a bar graph for the median income of each category
4. Show the Relationship between age and income for working-age individuals through a scatter plot
